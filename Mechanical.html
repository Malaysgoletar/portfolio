    <h1 class="h1">Mechanical Engineering Information</h1>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The application of mechanical engineering can be seen in the archives of various ancient and medieval societies.
        The six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp)
        were known since prehistoric times.[4] The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in
        Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC.[5] The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years
        ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale,[6] and to move large objects in ancient
        Egyptian technology.[7] The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine,
        which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC.[6] The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the
        early 2nd millennium BC.[8]</p>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>Degrees in mechanical engineering are offered at various universities worldwide. Mechanical engineering programs
        typically take four to five years of study depending on the place and university and result in a Bachelor of
        Engineering (B.Eng. or B.E.), Bachelor of Science (B.Sc. or B.S.), Bachelor of Science Engineering (B.Sc.Eng.),
        Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.), Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (B.M.E.), or Bachelor of Applied Science
        (B.A.Sc.) degree, in or with emphasis in mechanical engineering. In Spain, Portugal and most of South America,
        where neither B.S. nor B.Tech. programs have been adopted, the formal name for the degree is "Mechanical
        Engineer", and the course work is based on five or six years of training. In Italy the course work is based on
        five years of education, and training, but in order to qualify as an Engineer one has to pass a state exam at
        the end of the course. In Greece, the coursework is based on a five-year curriculum.[27]</p>
